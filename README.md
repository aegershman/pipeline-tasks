Common Concourse Pipeline Tasks

## Pipelines
Premise is to provide a set of resources, strung together serially, to take an application from build to production and the steps along the way. Pipeline is triggered at code commit, using maven and semver an artifact for deployment is created. The phases from development, test, stage and production can be setup using regulator and triggered manually unless otherise set.

### Push Webapp

## Examples

All examples use the following resources:

```yaml
resource_types:
- name: cf-cli-resource
  type: docker-image
  source:
    repository: pivotalpa/cf-cli-resource
    tag: latest

resources:
- name: pipeline-tasks
  type: git
  source:
    uri: https://github.com/Pivotal-Field-Engineering/pipeline-tasks.git
    branch: master

- name: cf-test
  type: cf-cli-resource
  source:
    api: https://api.run.pivotal.io
    skip_cert_check: false
    username: user@example.com
    password: oh-so-secret
    org: user-org
    space: test-space
```

## Generate a Cloud Foundry Manifest

```yaml
- name: test
  plan:
  - aggregate:
    - get: pipeline-tasks
    - get: artifact
  - task: generate-manifest
    file: pipeline-tasks/generate-manifest/task.yml
    params:
      MF_NAME: myapp
      MF_HOST: myapp
      MF_SERVICES: [ myapp-db, myapp-mq ]
      MF_ENV:
        RAILS_ENV: production
        RACK_ENV: production
        JBP_CONFIG_OPEN_JDK_JRE: '{ jre: { version: 1.8.0_+ }, memory_calculator: { stack_threads: 200 } }'
  - put: cf-push
    resource: cf-test
    params:
      command: zero-downtime-push
      manifest: task-output/manifest.yml
      path: artifact/myapp-*.jar
      current_app_name: {{cf-test-app-name}}
```

## Generate release information

This example showcases tasks commonly used with [github-release](https://github.com/concourse/github-release-resource):
* `generate-github-release`: Generates a version string (ex: v1.0.0) for the `release-name` and `release-tag` files.
* `generate-commitish`: Generates the [commitish](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/23303549/what-are-commit-ish-and-tree-ish-in-git) file.
* `generate-release-notes`: Generates the release notes for a particular version by parsing a change log format based on [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/) and [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

```yaml
- name: shipit
  serial_groups: [version]
  plan:
  - aggregate:
    - get: pipeline-tasks
    - get: project
      passed: [build]
    - get: version
      passed: [build]
      params: {bump: final}
  - task: generate-github-release
    file: pipeline-tasks/generate-github-release/task.yml
    output_mapping: {task-output: generate-github-release-output}
  - task: generate-commitish
    file: pipeline-tasks/generate-commitish/task.yml
    output_mapping: {task-output: generate-commitish-output}
  - task: generate-release-notes
    file: pipeline-tasks/generate-release-notes-from-changelog/task.yml
    input-mapping: {task-input: project}
    output-mapping: {task-output: generate-release-notes-output}
  - put: github-release
    params:
      name: generate-github-release-output/release-name
      tag: generate-github-release-output/release-tag
      commitish: generate-commitish-output/commitish
      body: generate-release-notes-output/RELEASE_NOTES.md
  - put: version
    params: {file: version/version}

```


## Overriding a task's VM

Imagine you want to use a task, but you want to use a different VM. For example, consider a `task.yml` that has:
```yaml
image_resource:
  type: docker-image
  source:
    repository: patrickcrocker/node
    tag: '1.0.0-rc.1'
```

If you need a VM with a different version of node, you can override the task's `image_resource`. In your pipeline, you'll need a `docker-image` resource pointing to the VM you'd like the task to use. Note: it's important that the VM you supply has the shell environment the task's `task.sh` uses. If the `task.sh` has an interrobang of `#!/bin/bash`, the VM you supply _must_ have `bash` available.

To override the `image_resource`, supply the task with an `image: ` resource:

```yaml
# VM we want the task to use
resources:
- name: vm-override
  type: docker-image
  source:
    repository: mhart/alpine-node
    tag: '8.9.1'

...

jobs:
- name: build
  plan:
  - aggregate:
    - get: vm-override # Make the VM available as a Job resource
    - get: pipeline-tasks
    - get: project
      resource: source-repo
      trigger: true
    - get: version
      params: {pre: rc}
  - task: build-node
    file: pipeline-tasks/build-node/task.yml
    image: vm-override # Override the task's `image_resource` with your VM
```
